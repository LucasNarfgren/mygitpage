          <p>
            Sweden is the largest country in the Nordic Region and has the biggest
            population. For many people, it is synonymous with flat-pack
            furniture, innovation, iron and steel. The country spends 3% of GDP on
            research and development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sweden shares land borders with Norway in the west and Finland in the
            northeast. It also has coasts facing its Nordic neighbours Denmark,
            Norway, Ã…land and Finland.
